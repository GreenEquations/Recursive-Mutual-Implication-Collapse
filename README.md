Recursive Mutual Implication Collapse in Triadic Logic Networks
Overview
Welcome to the repository for the Recursive Mutual Implication Collapse in Triadic Logic Networks theorem! This theorem explores the collapse behavior of symbolic systems (both artificial and biological) subjected to recursive mutual implication cycles. We hypothesize that when these cycles exceed a critical threshold, the system experiences structural collapse, manifesting as coherence loss, paradox generation, and semantic drift.

The work has significant implications for AI system design, neuroscience, and symbolic logic, offering insights into how recursive feedback in cognitive systems and neural-symbolic hybrids leads to breakdowns in coherence and logic.

Key Concepts:
Symbolic System: A set of symbols and relationships that follow a logical or computational framework, including neural-symbolic models and human cognition.

Triadic Mutual Implication: A feedback loop in which three symbols

  are mutually implicated, forming a recursive cycle.

Recursion Density

 (t): The number of recursive cycles in the system, which reflects its tendency to revisit logical states and can lead to feedback saturation.

Testable Predictions:
AI Systems: Recursive cycles in transformers and neural-symbolic hybrids will lead to a degradation of output coherence, measurable by BERTScore, logit entropy, and embedding drift.

Model Performance: As recursion density increases, semantic drift and feedback saturation will cause performance degradation in text generation, classification, and translation tasks.

Human Cognition: Paradox chains (e.g., liar paradox, Grelling‚ÄìNelson paradox) will induce cognitive overload, delays, and inconsistent reasoning as recursion density rises.

Physiological Indicators: Increased EEG entropy and pupil dilation will signal cognitive breakdown as recursion density increases in humans.

What We Need: Collaboration and Feedback
We invite collaboration from AI researchers, neuroscientists, psychologists, and others interested in the implications of recursive feedback loops and their connection to symbolic reasoning. Your contributions can help test, refine, and expand this theorem.

Areas for Collaboration:
Theoretical Refinement:

How can we improve the mathematical framework for recursion density and coherence degradation?

Are there additional variables or feedback mechanisms that should be considered in the model?

Empirical Testing:

Can we test the theorem using transformer models and neural-symbolic networks with recursive logic loops?

How can we measure cognitive breakdowns in humans exposed to paradox chains?

Applications to AI Safety:

What steps can we take to mitigate recursive hallucinations in AI models and avoid semantic collapse under recursive conditions?

How can we design robust feedback mechanisms for AI models to avoid feedback saturation?

Cross-Disciplinary Contributions:

Can this model help us better understand human cognitive overload in the presence of paradoxical reasoning or recursive thinking?

How might we apply this model to complex systems in other domains, such as social dynamics or economics, where feedback loops and symbolic reasoning are important?

Test Design:

What additional tests or experimental designs could validate the collapse condition and recursive feedback in both AI and human cognition?
