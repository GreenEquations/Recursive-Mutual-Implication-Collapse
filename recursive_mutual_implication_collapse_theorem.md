# üîÑ Recursive Mutual Implication Collapse Theorem (RMIC)

## I. Theorem Statement

In symbolic systems where three symbolic elements recursively imply one another in a closed triadic loop, there exists a threshold beyond which coherence degrades, information gain stagnates, and the system enters a collapse state.

Let:
- **Œ¶r(t)** ‚Äì System coherence over time
- **ŒîI(t)** ‚Äì Information gain per recursive step
- **Dr(t)** ‚Äì Recursion density (cycles per unit time)
- **Œ∏·µ£** ‚Äì Critical recursion threshold for collapse

If:

    Dr(t) > Œ∏·µ£

Then:

    d¬≤Œ¶r/dt¬≤ > 0     and     ŒîI(t) ‚Üí 0

Collapse behavior includes contradiction loops, hallucinated connections, and semantic drift.

## II. Collapse Mechanism

1. **Triadic Looping**  
   Symbols recursively imply one another in a closed cycle (A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C ‚Üí A), amplifying minor inconsistencies.

2. **Information Saturation**  
   ŒîI(t) approaches zero as the system generates increasingly redundant or unstable outputs.

3. **Entropy Escalation**  
   Logical connections lose structure; noise and contradictions increase.

## III. Collapse Indicators

- Spike in d¬≤Œ¶r/dt¬≤ (rate of coherence loss acceleration)
- Flattening or reversal of ŒîI(t) trends
- Embedding divergence across recursion steps
- Contradictions within the implication chain (e.g., A implies not-A)

## IV. Simulation Design

### Target Systems

- Recursive logic chains
- Transformer models with triadic self-reference
- Symbolic graphs with looped implication structures

### Measurements

- Mutual Information across loop steps
- BERTScore and entropy tracking
- Embedding similarity metrics (cosine distance)
- Collapse thresholds based on ŒîI(t) and Œ¶r(t)

---

## V. Visualization

- Plot of Œ¶r(t) and ŒîI(t) over recursion cycles
- Embedding space trajectory via UMAP/t-SNE
- Graph representations of triadic loop density

---

## VI. Cognitive Analogy

- Circular reasoning in belief systems or argumentation
- Mental overload from symbolic contradiction
- Breakdown in meaning when processing closed semantic loops

---

## VII. Applications

- **AI Model Design**: Detect and avoid unsafe recursive logic structures
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Monitor triadic loop density and semantic drift
- **Cognitive Modeling**: Simulate triadic contradiction collapse
- **Safety Engineering**: Implement thresholds for recursion density in symbolic engines

## VIII. Future Directions

- Extend RMIC to larger n-node loops (beyond triadic structure)
- Develop symbolic ‚Äúloop dampening‚Äù interventions
- Integrate collapse detection into knowledge graph engines
