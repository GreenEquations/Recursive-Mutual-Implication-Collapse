# Recursive Mutual Implication Collapse in Triadic Logic Networks (RMIC)

## Overview

This repository introduces the **Recursive Mutual Implication Collapse (RMIC) Theorem**, which formalizes a failure condition in symbolic systems structured around triadic implication loops.

When three symbolic elements (e.g., A, B, C) recursively imply one another in a closed loop (A ? B ? C ? A), the system may enter a state of collapse if recursion density exceeds a measurable threshold. Collapse is characterized by a loss of semantic coherence, diminishing information gain, and output instability.

## Key Terms

- **Triadic Implication Loop**: A closed cycle of mutual symbolic implication among three elements.
- **Fr(t)** – Coherence of the triadic system over time.
- **?I(t)** – Information gain per recursive cycle.
- **Dr(t)** – Recursion density (frequency of mutual implication cycles).
- **Collapse Condition** – Triggered when Dr(t) > critical threshold and ?I(t) approaches zero.

---

## Collapse Indicators

- Sudden spike in the second derivative of coherence: d²Fr/dt²
- Decline in ?I(t) over successive cycles
- Increase in symbolic entropy (loss of structure or logical consistency)
- Hallucinated connections or contradictions within the implication chain

---

## Simulation Framework

### Systems

- Logic engines with embedded implication cycles
- Recursive neural-symbolic systems
- AI-generated knowledge graphs with implied loop structures

### Measurements

- BERTScore and coherence scoring across recursion depth
- Mutual Information drop across nodes in the loop
- Entropy tracking via Shannon or cross-entropy measures
- Embedding drift in triadic symbolic units

### Tools

- MINE or CLUB for information gain estimation
- Cosine distance for embedding divergence
- Graph analysis libraries (e.g., NetworkX, igraph)

## Human Cognition Parallel

- Triadic contradiction loops (e.g., “A implies B, B implies C, C contradicts A”)
- Circular reasoning in logical debates or belief systems
- Working memory collapse under circular semantic loads

## Applications

- **Symbolic System Design**: Prevent collapse in triadic knowledge structures
- **AI Safety**: Detect feedback loops in large-scale language systems
- **Cognitive Modeling**: Simulate circular reasoning failure modes
